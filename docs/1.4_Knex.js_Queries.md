# 1.4 Knex.js Queries
The database tables are created and have sample data. Now we can have a look at how we to query the database in NodeJS using Knex.js query methods.

For this exercise, create a **test.js** file in the project's root folder. We will delete this file later on but use it for now to run some examples.

#### Get all users
To retrieve all users, put the code below in the **test.js** file
```js
// Include the knex package and config file
const Knex = require("knex");
const knexFile = require("./knexfile.js");

// Make the connection to the database
const knex = Knex(knexFile.development);

// Run queries
knex("todos")
  .where("user_id", 1)
  .then(rows => {
    for (let row of rows) {
      console.log(row);
    }
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.log(err);
    throw err;
  });
```
In the code above, we run all queries on the knex method, which takes a single argument, the table name to run the query on.
Then by chaining multiple query methods, can we finally handle the returned data using the `.then( )` method, which takes the query result as a callback from the previous chained methods.

The variable `rows` contains now all query results, and we console.log them using a for a loop.

A full list of available query methods can be found here [Query Builder - Knex.js](http://knexjs.org/#Builder)

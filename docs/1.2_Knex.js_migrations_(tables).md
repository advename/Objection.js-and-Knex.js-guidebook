# 1.2 Knex.js migrations (tables)
Weâ€™ll use Knex.js **migrations** to create our database tables and to track changes within our database schema. Migrations allow us to easily alter a table after we have already created all the tables.

We want to create the following tables using Knex.js instead of writing raw SQL. 
In regular SQL, the code to create the tables would look like the following
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
    id INTEGER AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    age INTEGER,
    PRIMARY KEY(id)
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS todos (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
    todo VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    done BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
    ON UPDATE CASCADE
    ON DELETE CASCADE,
    PRIMARY KEY(id)
)  ENGINE = InnoDB;
```
Above is a basic schema, covering an OneToMany foreign key relationship in the todos tables (One user can have Many todos).


### Creating migrations file
We are going to create two migration files, one to manage the **users** table and another for the **todos** table.

Create two migration files by executing the following code in your terminal
```shell
knex migrate:make create_tables
```
> **Note**
> Your migration name should be something descriptive, not simply the name of the table(s) that you are creating / modifying. Remember that throughout the lifetime of your app, there may be several migrations that all relate to the same database table. Hence, you want your migration names to inform other developers as to what that migration is doing.
> 

The previous command generates a **/migrations** folder in your project directory with a migration file inside:
- **20200331182227_create_tables.js**

Notice the long number in the filename.
It is a timestamp of the file creation time. Timestamps are necessary because Knex.js uses the timestamp to know which migrations to run first (This makes sense in a bit).

Opening the migrations file, you notice that they are almost empty except for a bit of boilerplate code.

There are two functions defined here
```js
// Executed during a migration
exports.up = function(knex) {
  
};

// Executed during a rollback
exports.down = function(knex) {
  
};
```

In the `exports.up( )` function, we define table names and columns to create in the database during migration. 
We use the `exports.down( )` function to specify what changes we want to undo during a rollback (usually used to drop the table).

> **Note:** 
> It is possible to create for each table one migration file. 
> E.g. *20200331182227_create_users.js* and  *20200331182227_create_todos.js*. This is also recommended for multiple application projects. Be careful choosing this approach as you **must** first create the users migration file before the todos due to the dependency and the migration order.

### Creating migrations
Our `exports.up( )` and `exports.down( )` functions should always return a promise, therefore is the `return` keyword necessary. We are going to tackle one after another.

#### exports.up( )
Inside of the `exports.down` function of your newly created migration file add the following code

**/migrations/20200331182227_create_tables.js**
```js
// Executed during a migration
exports.up = function(knex) {
  return knex.schema
    .createTable("users", table => {
      table.increments("id");
      table.string("name").notNullable();
      table.integer("age");
    })
    .createTable("todos", table => {
      table.increments("id");
      table.string("todo").notNullable();
      table.boolean("done").defaultTo(false);
      table.integer("user_id")
        .unsigned()
        .notNullable();

      // Set the foreign key
      table.foreign("user_id")
        .references("id")
        .inTable("users")
        .onDelete("CASCADE")
        .onUpdate('CASCADE');
    });
};
};
```
In the code above:
- we create a table with using the `.createTable(tableName, callback)` method
- we can chain multiple `.createTable(tableName, callback)` methods to create an additional table.
- the callback function takes an argument. Using the argument we can chain field methods to create columns with or without constraints.
- `increments("id")` is the equivalent to `INTEGER AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY` in SQL
- `.notNullable()` is the equivalent to `NOT NULL` in SQL
- `.defaultTo(value)` is the equivalent to `DEFAULT value` in SQL
- `.unsigned()` denies negative numerical values and is needed for foreign keys.
- `.foreign("user_id").references("id").inTable("users").onDelete("CASCADE").onUpdate('CASCADE');` is the equivalent to `FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE CASCADE` in SQL

Documentation: 
- [Schema Builder methods - Knex.js](http://knexjs.org/#Schema)
e.g. `.createTable(tableName, callback)`
- [Schema Builder field methods - Knex.js](https://knexjs.org/#Schema-Building) 
e.g. `.string("name")`
- [Schema Builder chainable field methods - Knex.js](https://knexjs.org/#Chainable) 
e.g. `.notNullable()`

#### exports.down( )
Inside of the `exports.down( )` function of your newly created migration file add the following code

**/migrations/20200331182227_create_tables.js**
```js
// Executed during a rollback
exports.down = function(knex) {
  return (
    knex.schema
      // Here, delete tables in reverse order because todos depends on users
      .dropTableIfExists("todos")
      .dropTableIfExists("users")
  );
};
```
In the code above:
- we delete a table with using the `.dropTableIfExists(tableName)` method, which also can be chained




#### Run migrations
Lastly, we have to apply the migration files, so that Knex.js creates the tables in our SQL database.

In your terminal, run
```shell
knex migrate:latest
```

You can log in to MySQL CLI or phpMyAdmin and check that the tables, alongside two knex tables, have been created.

Knex.js automatically create the tables *knex_migrations* and *knex_migrations_lock*. These tables maintain a running list of which migrations have been implemented. It is best not to touch those two.


#### Rollback migrations
If you ever wish to update the database tables, you either create an additional migrations file that alters the existing table, or you can run a rollback which deletes the tables, then do the required updates inside `exports.up( )` and `exports.down( )` functions and run a new migrations to re-create the updated migrations file.

However, best practice is that you should create a new migration file for each database change.

In your terminal, run
```shell
knex migrate:rollback
```
to rollback a migration.
